/**
 * The two you bring with you.
 *
 * At the start of a career the manager names two real friends, gives each of
 * them a standout quality and a position, and they join the club as twenty one
 * year olds who are, honestly, the worst players in the dressing room. That is
 * the whole point. Playing them costs points now, and only playing them turns
 * them into the two men the climb is built on.
 *
 * So they do not grow on the calendar like everybody else. They grow on
 * minutes: a friend who played every week has a summer, and a friend who
 * watched from the bench barely moves. Measured over five seasons, an ordinary
 * twenty one year old out of the generator gains four rating points and never
 * gets near seventy, because growth there is dominated by a hidden factor read
 * off his id and by an age bracket that shuts at twenty four. A friend is not
 * an ordinary player and does not use that road at all. He has his own ceiling,
 * written here, and his own rate, and both of them are Itzik's numbers.
 *
 * For scale, measured across twenty squads a division: the best player in
 * ליגה ג׳ rates 61, in ליגה א׳ 74, in the לאומית 80, in ליגת העל 84, and the
 * generator cannot hand anybody a ceiling above 90. Every quality below tops
 * out past the best man in the לאומית, and the passer, the one who is
 * deliberately dull for two summers, tops out above anything the game can
 * otherwise produce.
