 *
 * Four things hold here:

 *      twice, so a restarted career cannot invent people
 *   2. the road is walked: a whole career, phase by phase, reaches every step
 *      in order and skips none
 *   3. nothing personal can reach the wire, by reading the source rather than
 *      trusting it
 *   4. with no endpoint the game sends nothing at all, which is how it ships
